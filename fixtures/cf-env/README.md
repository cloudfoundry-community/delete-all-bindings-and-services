# Display Cloud Foundry environment variables

<img src="https://raw.github.com/cloudfoundry-community/cf-env/master/docs/images/demo.png" />

A simple Sinatra application. Once deployed to Cloud Foundry, it will echo the Environment and HTTP Request Headers.

This is especially useful to learn about service connection details (`$VCAP_SERVICES`) being passed to an application. Create them, bind them to this running application, and you'll see the nested JSON string that is set in `$VCAP_SERVICES`.

## Deploy

The repo contains a manifest file which creates a new application called `cfenv`, with a random string in the URL to avoid collisions.

To deploy:

```
$ cf push
Using manifest file manifest.yml
